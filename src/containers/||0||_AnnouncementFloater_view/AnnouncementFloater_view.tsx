      With roots in classical Latin literature, lorem ipsum has been the print industry's standard dummy text since the 16th century, and it was popularized in the 1960s. It has become the de facto placeholder text in web design, too (as gathering content from clients can often be a frustrating process), and is used in place of meaningful content during the design phase.</p>
      <p> Some argue that "real data delivers really effective design," and by using dummy text, you create a domino effect in your design that will have consequences when real content is added. But there are others who believe it can be a useful tool that still has value in the design process.
